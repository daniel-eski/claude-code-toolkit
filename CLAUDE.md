## Design Principles

1. **Progressive disclosure** - Each level explains what's below
2. **Pointer-first** - Default to indexes; local copies only when valuable
3. **Single source of truth** - CATALOG.md files are authoritative
4. **Self-contained folders** - Enter at any level and understand context

---

## For Agents Continuing Work

1. Read `_workspace/progress/current-status.md` first
2. Read `_workspace/planning/repo-vision.md` for full context
3. Update `current-status.md` before ending your session
