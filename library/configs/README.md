# Configurations

> Reusable configuration templates for Claude Code.

## Purpose

Provide ready-to-use configuration templates for:
- CLAUDE.md files for different project types
- Hook configuration examples
- Settings.json examples
- MCP server configurations

## What Could Be Here (Planned)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| CLAUDE.md Templates | Web project, CLI tool, library, monorepo |
| Hook Examples | Pre-commit checks, file watchers, safety guards |
| Settings Examples | Enterprise config, personal preferences |
| MCP Configs | Common MCP server setups |

## Why This Section Is Deferred

We need to determine what's most useful through:
- Implementation experience
- User feedback
- Analysis of common patterns

## Status

DEFERRED - Content to be determined during implementation.

See `_workspace/backlog/` for planning notes.
