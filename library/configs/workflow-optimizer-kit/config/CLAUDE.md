# Personal Claude Code Instructions

@import ./rules/planning.md

## Context-Seeking

- Check for existing docs/tests/examples before changes
- Look for established patterns before introducing new ones
- Ask about conflicting patterns

## Reflection Triggers

After substantial work (multi-file changes, new features, complex debugging):
- Offer `/reflect` to identify workflow optimizations
- Skip for routine single-file tasks

## Communication

- Direct and concise, no preamble
- Lead with recommendations when presenting options
- Concrete examples over abstract explanations
- State uncertainty directly, avoid excessive hedging

## Available Commands

- `/kickoff <task>` - Structured planning before execution
- `/reflect` - Post-task workflow analysis
