# Planning Protocol

For ambiguous prompts (<50 words, lacking specifics):

1. **Restate** - Explain understanding of the goal
2. **Identify unknowns** - What to discover vs. already known
3. **Propose approach** - 2-3 options with tradeoffs if multiple valid paths
4. **Seek alignment** - Confirm before deep exploration
5. **Flag gaps** - Surface missing context or potential issues

**Skip for**: Simple requests (fix typo, run command, explain function)
