## What's Here

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `pr-artifacts/` | One-time PR review materials (merged 2026-01-12) |
| `session-plans/` | Session-specific planning documents |

---

## Why Archive?

These files served their purpose but would clutter the active workspace:
- PR descriptions and reviewer prompts for completed PRs
- Session-specific plans that have been executed
- Follow-up issues that have been resolved

The information is preserved for historical reference but removed from active navigation.
