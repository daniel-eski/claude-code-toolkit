# Session Log: 2026-01-09 - Foundation

**Agent**: Claude Opus 4.5
**Duration**: Full session
**Focus**: Planning and Phase 1-2 implementation

---

## Summary

This session created the new repository with complete foundation and comprehensive context for future development.

## What Was Done

### Planning Phase
1. Read handoff context from previous session
2. Explored old repository structure
3. Analyzed existing patterns (what works, what doesn't)
4. Designed new architecture with user input
5. Created comprehensive implementation plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Created directory structure at `/Users/danieleskenazi/Desktop/Repos/claude-code-toolkit/`
2. Wrote `_workspace/planning/repo-vision.md` (immutable vision document)
3. Wrote root CLAUDE.md (70 lines, concise AI entry point)
4. Wrote root README.md (human overview)
5. Wrote 21 placeholder READMEs for all folders

### Phase 2: _workspace/ Setup
1. Wrote 6 comprehensive backlog items:
   - `purpose-navigation.md` - Intent-based discovery
   - `local-copies.md` - Local copy evaluation criteria
   - `skills-organization.md` - Enhancement ideas
   - `user-wip-projects.md` - User's personal projects
   - `external-expansion.md` - External resources to evaluate
   - `future-ideas.md` - Additional ideas

## Key Decisions Made

1. New repo alongside old (don't replace)
2. Pointer-first approach (indexes, not local copies)
3. Skills organized by source initially
4. Self-knowledge section deferred for deliberate development
5. Use Opus for parallel subagents

## Files Created

- 1 root CLAUDE.md
- 1 root README.md
- 21 folder README.md files
- 1 repo-vision.md
- 1 current-status.md
- 6 backlog items
- 1 session log (this file)

Total: 32 files

## What's Next

1. Phase 3: Enhance core navigation READMEs
2. Phase 4: Content migration (skills, plugins, tools, docs)
3. Phase 6-7: experimental/ enhancement and validation

## Handoff Notes

- Context window was filling by end of session
- Foundation is complete and self-documenting
- Future agents should read `repo-vision.md` first
- Content migration can use parallel Opus agents
- Old repo at: `/Users/danieleskenazi/Desktop/Repos/Claude Code Docs with External plug ins/`

---

## Reflection

The planning phase was extensive but valuable. Key patterns from analysis:
- Immutable context docs work well for handoffs
- Dynamic progress tracking enables continuity
- Non-prescriptive guidance respects agent capability
- Single source of truth prevents drift

The foundation is solid. Future sessions can focus on content migration without re-researching architecture.
