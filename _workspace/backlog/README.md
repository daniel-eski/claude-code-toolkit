# Backlog

> Future work items with comprehensive context for future agents.

## What's Here

Deferred work items that need development later. Each file provides:
- Clear explanation of the goal
- Why it was deferred
- Context for implementation
- Quality standards
- Suggested approach

## Backlog Items

| File | Topic | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| `purpose-navigation.md` | Intent-based discovery | Medium |
| `local-copies.md` | Frequently-referenced content | Low |
| `skills-organization.md` | Enhanced skills structure | Low |
| `user-wip-projects.md` | User's WIP integration | Variable |
| `external-expansion.md` | New external resources | Low |
| `future-ideas.md` | Additional ideas | Low |

## How to Use

When picking up deferred work:
1. Read the relevant backlog file for full context
2. Check `progress/current-status.md` for current state
3. Don't re-research what's already documented
4. Update status when complete

## Adding New Items

Create a markdown file with:
- Goal and why it matters
- Why it's deferred
- Implementation context
- Quality standards
- Suggested approach (non-prescriptive)

## Status

ACTIVE - Backlog items to be created with comprehensive context.
