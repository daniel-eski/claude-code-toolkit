## About This Navigation

This purpose-oriented navigation complements the existing catalog-based organization. The catalogs tell you **what's available**; these guides tell you **what to use when**.

Maintained as part of the claude-code-toolkit. See [../_workspace/backlog/purpose-navigation.md](../_workspace/backlog/purpose-navigation.md) for background.
