## What's Here

Work-in-progress skills that are being:
- Developed from scratch
- Tested before production deployment
- Refined based on usage

## How to Add a New Skill

1. Create a folder: `[skill-name]/`
2. Add `README.md` with:
   - What the skill does
   - Current development status
   - What needs testing
3. Add `SKILL.md` (can be draft)
4. Test and iterate

- [ ] Documented properly
- [ ] Any dependencies are clear

## Status
