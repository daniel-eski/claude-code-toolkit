# Experimental

> Work in progress: skills, plugins, and ideas being developed and tested.

## What's Here

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `skills/` | Skills in development |
| `plugins/` | Plugins in development |
| `ideas/` | Concepts not yet started |

## Purpose

This is the sandbox for:
- Testing new skills before they're production-ready
- Developing new plugins
- Exploring ideas that might become assets

## Graduation Path

When an asset is ready for production:

1. Verify it works as intended
2. Document it properly (README, SKILL.md/plugin.json)
3. Move from `experimental/` to `library/`
4. Add to appropriate CATALOG.md

## Development Workflow

1. Create a folder in the appropriate section (skills/, plugins/, or ideas/)
2. Add a README.md explaining what you're building and current status
3. Develop and test
4. Update status as you progress
5. Graduate to `library/` when production-ready

## Relationship to library/

| experimental/ | library/ |
|---------------|----------|
| Work in progress | Production-ready |
| May be incomplete | Fully documented |
| Testing phase | Verified working |
| Mirrors structure | Same structure |

## Status

PLACEHOLDER - Structure ready for development work.
